1. Write an object Conversions with methods inchesToCentimeters, gallonsToLiters, and milesToKilometers

2. The preceding problem wasnâ€™t very object-oriented. Provide a general superclass UnitConversion and ]
define objects InchesToCentimeters, GallonsToLiters, and MilesToKilometers that extend it.

value and x and y coordinates, such as new LabeledPoint("Black Thursday", 1929, 230.07)

6. Define an abstract class Shape with an abstract method centerPoint and subclasses
Rectangle and Circle. Provide appropriate constructors for the subclasses and
